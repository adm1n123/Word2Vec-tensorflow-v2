Skip gram sampling table is based on frequency of words and gives high probability of sampling for least frequent words
so (try to find freq and sort the words then generate indexing for words then pass to sequence for training).


Index 0 in vocab is treated as non-word by skipgrams() and no pairs(+ve/-ve) is generated with 0 as word index.
ie if index 0 appears in sequence it is skipped. from index 1 all the words are sampled.



General Errors:
    ### this usually occurs when vocabulary is not created(vocab size = 0) and embedding layer creating is called.
    since embedding layers needs vocab size before hand.
